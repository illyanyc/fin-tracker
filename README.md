## Technical analysis
### RSI
[Relative Strength Index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp), better known as RSI is a technical indicator used to determine is a particular security is overbought or oversold. It measures the magnitude of price change of the asset; and is an oscillator that moves between 0 and 100. RSI was developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. in 1978.

### MACD
[Moving average convergence divergence (MACD)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macd.asp) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a securityâ€™s price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA.

[Exponential moving average](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ema.asp) is a [moving average](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/movingaverage.asp) that places a greater weight to most recent data points and less to the older data points. In finance, EMA reacts more significantly to recent price changes than a [simple moving average (SMA)](, which applies an equal weight to all observations in the period.
In statistics, a moving average (MA), also known as simple moving average (SMA) in finance, is a calculation used to analyze data points by creating a series of averages of different subsets of the full data set.

MACD is used by traders to indicate bullish and bearish reversals when the EMA trendlines cross.
